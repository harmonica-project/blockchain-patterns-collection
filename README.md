# Blockchain pattern collection

__This repository is currently frozen, and only contains the patterns collected during our study. If you want to see the latest pattern collection and what we have done with it, please check the [blockchain-pattern-ontology repository](https://github.com/harmonica-project/blockchain-patterns-ontology).__

This repository contains a collection 160 of blockchain-based software patterns, obtained across 20 academic papers on blockchain-based patterns.
This collection is stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

## Content

In this file, you will find 5 sheets:
- Summary: gives an overview of retrieved patterns and the taxonomy used to classify them.
- Papers: lists all the papers studied during the systematic literature review, and if they have been accepted or rejected for the final corpus of papers.
- Raw patterns collection: lists all the collected patterns from the papers. Those patterns have been classified on different dimensions, and are described using a simplified pattern form.
- RQ2: synthesizes similar patterns from the raw patterns collection to single patterns. 
- RQ3: identifies the number of proposed patterns from existing software patterns non-related to blockchain technology (eg. GoF patterns).
- RQ4: contains the application domain and technology addressed by the different papers.
- QQ: contains the answers attributed to quality questions that evaluates papers on different aspects (check the paper for question details)
