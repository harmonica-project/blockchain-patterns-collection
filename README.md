# Blockchain pattern collection

This repository contains a collection 160 of blockchain-based software patterns, obtained across 20 academic papers on blockchain-based patterns.
This collection is stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

## Content

In this file, you will find 7 sheets:
- Summary: gives an overview of retrieved patterns and the taxonomy used to classify them.
- Papers: lists all the papers studied during the systematic literature review, and if they have been accepted or rejected for the final corpus of papers.
- Raw patterns collection: lists all the collected patterns from the papers. Those patterns have been classified on different dimensions, and are described using a simplified pattern form.
- RQ2: synthesizes similar patterns from the raw patterns collection to single patterns. 
- RQ3: identifies the number of proposed patterns from existing software patterns non-related to blockchain technology (eg. GoF patterns).
- RQ4: contains the application domain and technology addressed by the different papers.
- QQ: contains the answers attributed to quality questions that evaluates papers on different aspects (check the paper for question details)
